# RaccStarLogan Website

![Logo](https://raccstarlogan.com/headerlogo.png)

This is the source code for my personal site: [raccstarlogan.com](https://raccstarlogan.com), hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org)
It serves as my little hub for art, music, characters, and whatever else I feel like putting online.

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

- This repository gives you direct access to any files on this website, which may include sensitive and/or adult content.
- Also this code is like really really bad. I suck at coding. Please help.
- Viewer discretion is advised.

## What’s Inside
- Static HTML, CSS, and a few small scripts (nothing too complicated)
- Pages for my characters, commissions, portfolio, and other projects
- File hosting for use on other sites ([ToyHou.se](https://toyhou.se), [ArtFight](https://artfight.net), etc.)
- Some fun extras

## Running Locally
Not sure why you'd want to do this, but just open `public/index.html`.

If you’d like to clone it anyway:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaccStarLogan/rsl-website.git
cd rsl-website/public
open index.html
```

Thank you for taking the time to look in here! If you notice any issues, feel free to let me know through an [Issues report](https://github.com/RaccStarLogan/rsl-website/issues).
