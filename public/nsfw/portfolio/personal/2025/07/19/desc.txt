<p>silly snivy got his arm stuck in this comically small cookie jar</p>
<p>This is an ArtFight friendly fire attack I did for <a href="https://artfight.net/~Sneeve" target="_blank">Sneeve</a> of his skulldragon form.</p>
<p>I noticed there weren't a lot of skulldragons on ArtFight, but I really wanted to draw a skulldragon and I saw Sneeve again, so I thought "hey, why not draw him again?"</p>
