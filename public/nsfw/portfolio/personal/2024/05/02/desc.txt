<p>This was my first time drawing vore. Admittedly I was more focused on making Kybu a massive blob than I was trying to make this look like vore. But hey. It exists.</p>
<p>Drew this as a gift for my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kybutheraptor/" target="_blank">KybuTheRaptor</a> soon after we both found out we were into fat furs and by extension vore.</p>
