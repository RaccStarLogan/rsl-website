<p>Skulldragon species created by <a href="https://furaffinity.net/user/CamuuShamuu" target="_blank"><b>CamuuShamuu</b></a></p>
<p>I thought I'd make a skulldragon variant of Jesper since he already has a skull for a mask anyways, and I thought it'd be funny to see what he'd look like if he put on the wrong mask waking up in the morning.</p>
<p>Since he's got heterochromia in his eyes, I decided to make it so his magic aura stuff is like the two colors blended. So that means he's orange!</p>
