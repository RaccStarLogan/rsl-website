<p>uh oh logan got in debt with the mafia</p>
<p>i might've completely misinterpreted the mafia thing but ehh whatever</p>
<p>This is an ArtFight attack I did for <a href="https://artfight.net/~TrevorTouchdown" target="_blank">TrevorTouchdown</a> of her mafia boss crow Trevor sitting accross the table from Logan asking about some unpaid debt.</p>
<p>I've wanted to draw this character for a long time since commissioning Trevor myself a few months prior, but I could never make something I was actually proud of. This was the point where I actually felt proud of what I came up with, and I'm happy how it came out.
