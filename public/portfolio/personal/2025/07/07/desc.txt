<p>Judas designed by <a href="https://vgen.co/constellist" target="_blank">constellist</a></p>
<p>This is a theme I decided to make for my character Judas. I had a bit of trouble actually coming up with anything for a good chunk of working on the song, but once I had a better idea of who Judas was as a character, I could actually make something decent with that idea. Overall, I'm proud of how this turned out.</p>
<p>This particular song was originally gonna be in 4/4 but I ended up changing it to 3/4 since it fit Judas' vibe more. However, I do still have a draft saved of this before I made the decision to make it 3/4 and if you'd like to take a listen to that, you can listen to it here:</p>
