<p>Judas designed by <a href="https://vgen.co/constellist" target="_blank">constellist</a></p>
<p>This is a theme I decided to make for my character Judas. I had a bit of trouble actually coming up with anything for a good chunk of working on the song, but once I had a better idea of who Judas was as a character, I could actually make something decent with that idea. Overall, I'm proud of how this turned out.</p>
