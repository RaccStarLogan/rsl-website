          <h1>Howdy!</h1>
          <p>I'm Logan Foster, a raccoon on the internet who does stuff and people think that's cool üëç</p>
          <p>I'm a furry who makes digital art, animations, and music as a hobby. I also do voice acting whenever possible!</p>
          <p>I work at Pizza Hut, making pizzas and ensuring everything is prepared correctly.</p>
          <p>I have some experience in coding (if you couldn't tell), but not enough to call myself a programmer by any means. However, that doesn't mean I'm not interested in tech! I particularly enjoy retro/vintage tech, even if those terms make me feel old.</p>
          <p>All in all, I make stuff that people enjoy, whether it's art, food, or just stupid memes on the internet.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Enid, Oklahoma, and moved to San Antonio, Texas soon after, where I ended up being raised for most of my life.</p>
        <p>I've always been somewhat interested in making stuff, but I particularly started drawing sometime in 4th or 5th grade, inspired mostly by Sonic the Hedgehog. I didn't take drawing as seriously in middle school, so I decided to try and pursue music by joining my school's choir program. I also tried making YouTube videos under the alias "Shadow's Friend" or "Shad The Hedgehog". That channel has since been deleted, but I took my experience with video editing and making internet content with me once I started taking my art more seriously.</p>
        <p>High school rolled around, and I decided to give art more of a serious chance. Typically I'd be making stuff in Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator during my Principles of AAVTC class. Before we got drawing tablets in that class, it would usually be simple stuff like a dog made of simple shapes, and abstract stuff in general. Once we got access to drawing tablets though, I started to draw myself in silly little situations before eventually switching to making original characters.</p>
        <p>Then came COVID-19. That would be the start of a huge turning point in my life. Yeah, there was online schooling (which was hell for me btw), but there was also the fear that I wouldn't be able to keep the apartment that my family had been living in at the time. All of the stress with the pandemic along with that took a pretty big toll on my mental health. It was only a matter of time before we eventually got evicted from our apartment and had to move out.</p>
        <p>It was around this time that I also tried taking my music more seriously as well. While yes, a lot of my works around the time were Undertale remixes, then eventually Friday Night Funkin' mod remixes, I did branch out to make some original stuff a few years later.</p>
        <p>Halfway through my sophomore year, I was curious about the furry fandom. I asked my sister-in-law what animal she thought I would be, and she told me I'd be a raccoon, so I just drew myself as a raccoon. That same raccoon is my fursona to this day, albeit with a few design tweaks and improvements.</p>
        <p>The rest of my high school years had their ups and downs. English classes? Let's just say I got a bit lazy with it. But alas, I still pulled through and was able to walk the stage in 2023. I would like to give a shoutout to my Audio/Video Production/Animation teacher, Ms. Judy Priest, for letting some of my work be shown in the yearbook and inspiring me to keep pushing forward in my creative works, despite everything going on with my life.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to <a href="https://raccstarlogan.com/portfolio">explore my portfolio</a> and <a href="https://raccstarlogan.com/social-links">connect with me on social media</a> to see more of my work and stay updated on my creative journey.</p>
